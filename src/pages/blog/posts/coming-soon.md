## We're Building Collective Social

We're excited to announce that **Collective Social** is coming soon — a new way to curate lists, track your progress, and share recommendations across books, movies, TV shows, and more.

### What is Collective Social?

Collective Social is your personal space on the open social web. Built on the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/), it gives you full ownership of your data while making it easy to:

- **Create collections** of your favorite media — books you've read, movies you've watched, shows you're binging
- **Track your progress** with statuses, ratings, and notes
- **Share recommendations** with friends and communities
- **Join groups** to discover what others are enjoying

### Built on the Open Social Web

Unlike traditional platforms, Collective Social is built on AT Protocol — the same decentralized technology behind Bluesky. This means your data belongs to you, and you can take it anywhere.

### Stay in Touch

We'll be sharing more updates on this blog as we approach launch. In the meantime, feel free to reach out at [brittany@balancedengineer.com](mailto:brittany@balancedengineer.com) with questions or to express interest in early access.
